## Solutions 

[  Please provide the command to invoke the script that reproduces the below solutions here.  ] 

<br>

#### 1. Alignment   

[  If you have reasons for using the aligner that you've used, please provide them here.  ]

<br> Bowtie2 is used to for aligning many different reads to one read, so I felt that it would be the best and most efficient option available. 

#### 2. Fractional Coverage 

[  Please list the fractional coverages for each sample here. If this lives in a file, just specify the 
path.  ]

<br> 
Fractional Coverage for Each Sample:
sample0.1        21.88 %
sample0.2        3.33 %
sample1.1        51.75 %
sample1.2        51.16 %
sample2.1        0.00 %
sample2.2        0.00 %
sample3.1        65.82 %
sample3.2        62.77 %


#### 3. Visualizing Fractional Coverage (Bonus)

[  Please include the resulting plot here. You can include images in `markdown` like 
`!(image_name)[/path/to/image]`.  ]
