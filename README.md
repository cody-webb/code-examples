# code-examples
Examples of Code and Projects I have worked on.

This repo is full of various projects that I have worked on in my undergraduate and graduate careers, 
as well as some miscellaneous other code that I have worked on. 

Some of these may not be entirely accurate to the finished product, as in the past I have not been 
as careful with my documentation. 

I might make some minor tweaks to smaller projects on here eventually to better reflect my coding
abilities that I have now. 

I'll try my best to keep this updated and upgrade the quality of the code that I made prior to 
making this repository.
